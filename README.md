This is a JavaScript layer to provide additional functionality and fixes (imo) to the Shopify dashboard. It adds some complexity to the dashboard so it's intended more for developers, or store owners that understand theme editing.

A seperate tool is being made that allows easy ways for store owners to edit metafields via Custom Fields. Check the [Project Homepage](http://shopify.freakdesign.com.au/index.html#customfields) for info. 

Latest Builds

Already using this tool? [Leave a tip](http://shopify.freakdesign.com.au/#donate) to support the development! Those energy drinks aren't cheap - keep me caffeinated so I can keep working on the tool.

Notes

Only the minified version of the script is loaded and I'll make that file as required. Any pull requests should be made to the unminified verison, complete with nice verbose comments for other devs.
